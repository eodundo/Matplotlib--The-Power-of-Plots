The project is using pandas to clean mouse data for the remaining steps and generated a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

Generating a bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the total number of measurements taken for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study.

Creating a pie plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.

Using Matplotlib to generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.
